# My Portfolio Project

This is my first IT project. I created this page as a part of an IT course that I am currently doing. This webpage contains my portfolio where people can know who I am. I have included basic information about myself, my educations, my experiences, as well as how to contact me.  

UX
---
This webpage can be used by any potential employers or company who would like to hire me to get detailed information about myself. 
I like to keep the website simple as it suits my style and make it easier for any readers to navigate around the website.  

## Features

- Footer - It is located at the bottom of each page in the center.
